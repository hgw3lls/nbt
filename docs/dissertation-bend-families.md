# Dissertation Bend Families

This toolkit includes eight bend families, each producing:

- baseline vs bent comparison artifacts
- metrics + qualitative samples
- auto-generated `theory_memo.md` in run folder

## Families

1. Embedding Contamination (`family-embedding-contamination`)
2. Corpus Stratigraphy (`family-corpus-stratigraphy`)
3. Inter-Head Drift (`family-inter-head-drift`)
4. Governance Dissonance (`family-governance-dissonance`)
5. Residual Distortion (`family-residual-distortion`)
6. Norm Perturbation (`family-norm-perturbation`)
7. Justice Reweighting (`family-justice-reweighting`)
8. Justice Attractors (`family-justice-attractors`)

Each family uses bend primitives from `neural_bending_toolkit.bends.primitives` with explicit safety and rollback semantics.
